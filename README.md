# volunteer-connect

design and develop a Web Application that allows Volunteer Organizations promote themselves, find new members, and keep their existing members updated.



Users should be able to sign up and log in to the system in order to
Sign up/log in.
Manage their user information.
Join a Volunteer Organization.
View updates from Volunteer Organization they're members of.
See upcoming Volunteer Organization events and RSVP.
Volunteer Organization Managers should be able to log in in order to:
Sign up/log in.
Manage their user information.
View their members
Post updates both publicly, and privately to their members.
Create and update Volunteer Organization events.
See who has RVSP'd for an event.
System Admins (users who can manage the whole system) should be able to log in in order to:
Manage their user information.
Manage Users.
Manage branches of the Volunteer Organization.
Sign-up other Admins.
Users should be able to choose to link a social media/email/other account, allowing login via that platform, to make logging in easier.
Users without accounts should be able to view public information and updates for the Volunteer Organization.
One (1) of the following three (3) special features must also be present (2 for PG Students):

Email notifications
Users can sign up to receive email notifications from the Volunteer Organization for things like updates and special events.
Users should be able to choose which types of email notifications are sent for each Volunteer Organization and which Volunteer Organizations they receive those notifications from.
